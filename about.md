I am a Ph.D. candidate from the department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Penn State University. 
With near 10 years of battery related energy storage research experience, I am very enthusiastic at the clean energy development and the application of engineering analytics.
As a graduate assistant, I delivered lectures and lab instructions for several undergraduate courses, e.g. IE 311, IE 312, etc..

<h5>Research Expertise and Current Interests</h5>
Electrode materials, Solid-state electrolyte, Structural battery, Composite design, Low temperature sintering process, and Advanced manufacturing.

Together with data-driven analysis and optimization algorithms, promoting the development of the Lithium-ion batteries and beyond.
