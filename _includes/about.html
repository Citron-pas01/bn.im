                       I am a Ph.D. candidate from the department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Penn State University.
                       With near 10 years of battery-related energy storage research experience, I am very enthusiastic at clean energy development and the application of engineering analytics.
                       As a graduate assistant, I delivered lectures and lab instructions for several undergraduate courses, e.g. IE 311, IE 312, etc.
